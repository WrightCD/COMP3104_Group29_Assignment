Devops enables better software development and delivery

DevOps is a set of practices, principles, and cultural philosophies that aim to 
improve collaboration and communication between software development (Dev) and 
IT operations (Ops) teams. The primary goal of DevOps is to shorten the 
software development lifecycle, increase the frequency of software releases, 
and improve the quality and reliability of software applications. It 
emphasizes the automation of processes, continuous integration, continuous 
delivery, and a feedback-driven approach.
